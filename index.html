				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					For this project, I chose to redesign the Dallas Library website (<a
						href="https://dallaslibrary2.org/"
						target="_blank"
						>dallaslibrary2.org</a
					>) because its design appears dated and can benefit from a more modern, accessible, and responsive interface
					that better serves its diverse audience.

				<h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>

				<h3>Chosen Interface</h3>
				<p>
					The Dallas Library website is publicly accessible and was selected due to its cluttered navigation and
					outdated visual elements that hinder efficient user interaction.
				</p>

				<h3>Usability & Accessibility Issues</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Efficiency:</strong> The navigation menus and content layout are very cluttered, making it
						challenging for users to quickly find important features like event calendars or catalog search.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Learnability:</strong> Inconsistent visual cues and outdated design elements may confuse new users,
						affecting their ability to quickly learn the website's layout.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Memorability:</strong> A lack of consistent design patterns makes it difficult for returning users
						to remember where to locate key information.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Accessibility:</strong> A WebAIM WAVE analysis revealed issues like missing alt text, missing page
						regions, and very small text which could hinder users with visual impairments.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h2>

				<h3>Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
				<p>
					The style guide defines a modern color palette, accessible typography, and consistent design components to
					ensure a cohesive experience throughout the site.

				<h2>Part 3: Responsive Redesign</h2>
				<p>
					Building on the style guide and mockups, I implemented a responsive redesign of the Dallas Library website
					using HTML and CSS. The new design adapts fluidly to mobile, tablet, and desktop views while addressing the
					usability and accessibility issues identified in Part 1.

				<h2>Project Reflection & Lessons Learned</h2>
				<p>
					This project allowed me to address significant usability and accessibility challenges on an existing public
					interface. By updating the visual style, simplifying navigation, and ensuring a responsive design, the
					redesigned Dallas Library website now provides a more intuitive and engaging user experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					The process emphasized the importance of a cohesive style guide and cross-device testing, ensuring that design
					decisions enhance both user satisfaction and accessibility.
