			<h1>Responsive Redesign: Dallas Library Website</h1>

			<section id="introduction">
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					The Dallas Public Library serves a wide and diverse population â€” but its website doesn't. From cluttered menus
					to inconsistent visuals and poor mobile optimization, the original site posed real barriers to efficient use.
					Whether you're trying to find event information or search the catalog, the interface often feels more like an
					obstacle than a tool.
				</p>
				<p>
					This redesign project reimagines the Dallas Library's website with a focus on clarity, accessibility, and
					modern responsiveness. The goal was to create an inclusive, user-friendly experience that functions seamlessly
					across devices. Starting with a usability audit, I identified key pain points and then used visual design
					principles, HTML/CSS implementation, and iterative testing to craft a more navigable and visually coherent
					alternative.

				<h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>

				<h3>Chosen Interface</h3>
				<p>
					The Dallas Library website is publicly accessible and was selected due to its cluttered navigation and
					outdated visual elements that hinder efficient user interaction.
				</p>

				<h3>Usability & Accessibility Issues</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Efficiency:</strong> The navigation menus and content layout are very cluttered, making it
						challenging for users to quickly find important features like event calendars or catalog search.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Learnability:</strong> Inconsistent visual cues and outdated design elements may confuse new users,
						affecting their ability to quickly learn the website's layout.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Memorability:</strong> A lack of consistent design patterns makes it difficult for returning users
						to remember where to locate key information.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Accessibility:</strong> A WebAIM WAVE analysis revealed issues like missing alt text, missing page
						regions, and very small text which could hinder users with visual impairments.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h2>

				<h3>Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
				<p>
					The style guide defines a modern color palette, accessible typography, and consistent design components to
					ensure a cohesive experience throughout the site.

				<h2>Part 3: Responsive Redesign</h2>
				<p>
					Building on the style guide and mockups, I implemented a responsive redesign of the Dallas Library website
					using HTML and CSS. The new design adapts fluidly to mobile, tablet, and desktop views while addressing the
					usability and accessibility issues identified in Part 1.

			<section id="conclusion">
				<h2>Project Reflection & Lessons Learned</h2>
				<p>
					This project was a powerful reminder that good design is often invisible: users notice it most when it's
					missing. Redesigning the Dallas Library website helped me think critically about accessibility not as a
					checklist, but as a mindset: designing for real users in real contexts.
				</p>
				<p>
					By reworking layout hierarchies, visual cues, and responsive behavior, I created a more welcoming experience
					for both first-time visitors and longtime users. The process reinforced the value of style guides,
					mobile-first thinking, and cross-device testing as pillars of modern web design.
				</p>
				<p>
					More broadly, this redesign emphasized the importance of advocacy through design. Simple, thoughtful changes
					can expand access to public resources and make a city's digital front door feel open to all.
